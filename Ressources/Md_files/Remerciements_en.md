OFFICIAL THANK YOU FOR A CALCULATOR THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE WORKED, BUT SOMEHOW DOES.
(against all odds, and especially against all human logic)

Eight people. Eight brains.
One goal: to build a calculator in C.
And no, this wasn’t an action movie – though it totally deserved a dramatic soundtrack and a few exploding compilers.

We’re talking about eight brave individuals who willingly made friends with pointers, scanf, and if statements that had more conditions than a celebrity prenup.

They battled segmentation faults, uninitialized variables, and that tragic moment when you forget a ; on line 117.

Their code? A masterpiece.
Their logic? Flawless.
Their comment humor? Questionable, but lovable.

Among them were:

An arithmetic strategist who tamed the division operation without triggering / 0 Armageddon.

A philosopher of conditionals, for whom every else was a spiritual journey.

A debugging wizard who spoke fluent warning-ese.

An alchemist of variables, turning int into pure gold (or at least into something that compiled).

A Makefile magician who conjured an executable from the abyss.

A printf poet whose error messages were almost touching.

An architect of modularity who split the code like Moses parted the sea.

And a silent ninja who fixed everything at 4 a.m. while the world dreamed of pizza.

The result?
A working, efficient, objectively beautiful calculator (yes, beautiful—for a C program).
A feat. A legend. Proof that with enough coffee, anything is possible.

Thanks to this team, we now calculate without Excel, subtract without brain pain, and multiply without tears.

The calculator is done. But the legend has just begun.
